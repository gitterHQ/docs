# Streaming API

**Use the streaming API to listen to messsages, events and changes in rooms.** The streaming API allows real-time access to rooms. Unlike other APIs, all requests to the streaming API should be made to *stream.gitter.im*. Authentication is identical to [the REST API Authentication](authentication).

## Connecting

To connect to the Streaming API, form a HTTP request and consume the resulting stream for as long as is practical. The Gitter servers will hold the connection open indefinitely (barring a server-side error, excessive client-side lag, network hiccups or routine server maintenance). If the server returns an unexpected response code, clients should a wait few seconds before trying again.

## Content Types

The streaming API supports JSON stream content type.

Content is encoded as UTF-8.

### JSON Stream (`application/json`)

The JSON stream returns messages as JSON objects that are delimited by carriage return (`\r`). Newline characters (`\n`) may occur in messages, but carriage returns should not.

Parsers must be tolerant of occasional extra newline characters placed between messages. These characters are sent as periodic "keep-alive" messages to tell clients and NAT firewalls that the connection is still alive during low message volume periods.

## Resources

```
GET /v1/rooms/:roomId/:resource
```

Available resources are:
- `chatMessages`
- `events`

Returns rooms messages as they come in.

Try it from the CLI:
```
$ curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {{token}}" "{{stream_url}}/v1/rooms/:roomId/chatMessages"
```
